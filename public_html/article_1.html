    <p style="font-size:19px">
        Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world in recent years.
        It's used in everything from machine learning to building websites and software testing.
        It can be used by developers and non-developers alike.
        There are many languages out there, so what makes Python such a popular choice? The answer is its flexibility and ease of use
        Python reads like executable Pseudocode, which makes it easier to understand and implement.
        There are multiple paradigms that are accessible to Python developers, including the popular object-oriented programming.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:19px">
        Before learning any programming language, we should familiarise ourselves with the important features of
        Object-oriented programming, this will help us to write code more efficiently and easily.
        <br>
    </p>

    <div class="para2">
    <p style="font-size:17px">
        <b>Factory in OOP</b><br>
        Factory Method is a creation design pattern used to create concrete implementations of a common interface.
        It separates the process of creating an object from the code that depends on the interface of the object.
        <br><br>
        <b>Instantiation</b><br>
        In OOP (object-oriented programming), a class of object may be defined. All objects of this class have a certain
        set of properties (associated variables), accessories (ways to access those variables), and methods (functions).
        An instance of that object may then be declared, giving it a unique, named identity so that it may be used in the program.
        This process is called "instantiation."
        <br><br>
        <b>Object</b><br>
        An instance of a particular class. In general, any number of objects may be constructed from a class definition.
        The class to which an object belongs defines the general characteristics of all instances of that class.
        Within those characteristics, an object will behave according to the current state of its attributes and environment.
        <br><br>
        <b>Class</b><br>
        A programming language concept that allows data and methods to be grouped together. The class concept is fundamental
        to the notion of an object-oriented programming language. The methods of a class define the set of permitted operations
        on the class's data (its attributes). This close tie between data and operations means that an instance of a class -
        an object - is responsible for responding to messages received via its defining class's methods.
        <br><br>
        <b>Namespace</b><br>
        The area of a program in which particular identifiers are visible. Java uses packages to provide namespaces, and its
        visibility rules - private, package, protected, public - variously contain identifiers within namespaces.
        <br><br>
        <b>Constructor</b><br>
        When a class or struct is created, its constructor is called. Constructors have the same name as the class or struct,
        and they usually initialize the data members of the new object.
        <br><br>
        <b>Fixture</b><br>
        These are functions attached to the tests which run before the test function is executed. Fixtures are a set of
        resources that have to be set up before and cleaned up once the Selenium test automation execution is completed.
        <br><br>
        <b>Type Hint</b><br>
        Type hinting is a formal solution to statically indicate the type of a value within your Python code.
        <br><br>
        <b>Type Cast</b><br>
        Type Casting is a process in which we convert a literal of one type to another.
        Inbuilt functions' int(), float() and str() shall be used for typecasting.
        <br><br>
        <b>Unit test</b><br>
        Unit Testing in Python. ... Unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source
        code are put under various tests to determine whether they are fit for use.
        It determines and ascertains the quality of your code
        <br><br>
        <b>Static</b><br>
        Static functions are used to invoke a class code when none of its instance exists( in purer oop languages).
        Static functions can change static variables. Declaring class properties or methods as static makes them accessible
        without needing an instantiation of the class
        <br><br>
        <b>Class Method</b><br>
        A class method is one with the static reserved word in its header.
        Static methods differ from all other methods in that they are not associated with any particular instance of the
        class to which they belong. They are usually accessed directly via the name of the class in which they are defined.
        <br><br>
        <b>Facade</b><br>
        Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified (but limited) interface to a complex system of classes,
        library or framework. While Facade decreases the overall complexity of the application, it also helps to move
        unwanted dependencies to one place.
        <br><br>
        <b>Design Patterns</b><br>
        A design pattern provides a general reusable solution for the common problems that occur in software design.
        The pattern typically shows relationships and interactions between classes or objects. The idea is to speed up the
        development process by providing well-tested, proven development/design paradigms.
        <br><br>
        <b>Method</b><br>
        The part of a class definition that implements some of the behavior of objects of the class.
        The body of the method contains declarations of local variables and statements to implement the behavior.
        A method receives input via its arguments, if any, and may return a result if it has not been declared as void.
        <br><br>
        <b>Property</b><br>
        The property() method in Python provides an interface to instance attributes. It encapsulates instance attributes and
        provides a property, same as Java and C#. The property() method takes the get, set and delete methods as arguments and
        returns an object of the property class

    <h3>Pylint as a linter</h3>
    <p style="font-size:19px">
        One of the greatest tools one must know when coding in python is <b>Pylint</b>. Pylint is a Python static code analysis tool that looks
        for programming errors, helps enforce a coding standard, sniffs for code smells, and offers simple refactoring suggestions.
        It’s highly configurable, having special pragmas to control its errors and warnings from within your code,
        as well as from an extensive configuration file. It is also possible to write your own plugins for adding your
        own checks or for extending pylint in one way or another. As Pylint is “Static”, it means that
        it won’t execute your code, it will just parse it to find mistakes or things that do not respect a given coding style.

        <br><br>
        Pylint messages fall into the categories in the following table, It is important that we understand the different categories of
        the errors.
        The nice thing about pylint output is that the lint is labeled by category.
        You can choose to ignore certain errors if you don’t care to adhere to a specific convention as well.
    </p>
<br>
    <table class="table table-striped" style="font-size:18px">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Pylint category</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Convention (C)</td>
            <td>[C]onvention for coding standard violation</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Refactor (R)</td>
            <td>[R]efactor for a “good practice” metric violation</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Warning (W)</td>
            <td>[W]arning for stylistic problems, or minor programming issues</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Error (E)</td>
            <td>[E]rror for important programming issues (i.e. most probably bug)</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Fatal (F)</td>
            <td>[F]atal for errors which prevented further processing</td>

        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p style="font-size:19px">
        When pylint is run on <a href="https://github.com/madhurima309/calc2">this</a> piece of code,
        we get the below, from the table above, we can see that they are Convention (C) and Warning (W)

    <p style="font-size:19px">
        This basically means that line 11 violates a convention ‘C’.
        It’s telling us that we should have a docstring.
        This is Correct, a docstring is required, but what if we didn’t fully understand what rule was violated.
        Knowing only that a convention is violated isn’t much help if we are a newbie.
        Another information here is the message between the parenthesis, “missing-docstring”.
        <br>
        Once we understand the message in the parenthesis, we can easily correct our python code to eliminate the issues.
        <br><br>
        However, there are other errors thrown by pylint which are not necessarily a code error on our part such as the Refactor (R)
    </p>

<div class="al">

</div>
<br>
<div class="para0">
    <p style="font-size:19px">
        From a (pure) object-oriented programming perspective, a class (and its instances)
        shall bundle data (the object’s attributes) and behavior (its methods).
        If a class does not expose any public methods, this rule is violated.
        In Python, the correct amount of public methods should be more than 5 for pylint to not throw this error,
        thus there are cases where the pylint error thrown is not essentially correct or needed.

        <br> <br>
        In Pylint have an option of suppressing pylint errors, if we feel that we do not wish to follow the code style
        pylint is designed for or if we have errors such as above

        What Pylint says is not to be taken as gospel and Pylint isn't smarter than you are: it may warn you about things
        that you have conscientiously done.
        Pylint tries hard to report as few false positives as possible for errors, but it may be too verbose with warnings.
        That's for example because it tries to detect things that may be dangerous in a context, but are not in others, or
        because it checks for some things that you don't care about. Generally, we shouldn't expect Pylint to be totally quiet
        about the code
        <br># pylint: disable=wildcard-import, method-hidden
        <br># pylint: enable=too-many-lines
        <br># pylint: skip-file
        <br>The above highlighted method can be used to suppress pylint errors that are of no consequence. We need to use the above syntax of
        #pylint followed by the messages that we are trying to suppress. The code reference for this tutorial can be found
