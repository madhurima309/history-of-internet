    <h1>Separation of Concerns: Clean coding practices</h1>
</div>

<div class="al">

    <p style="font-size:19px">
        A cornerstone of clear code is the division of its various behaviors into small, manageable pieces.
        Clear code requires you to keep less knowledge in your head at any given time, making the code simpler to
        reason about. Short segments of code with clear intent are a big step in this direction, but bits of code
        should not be broken up along arbitrary boundaries. Separating them by concern is an effective approach.
        <br>
        A <b><em>concern</em></b> is a distinct behavior or piece of knowledge your software deals with. Concerns can range
        in granularity from how to calculate a square root to how payments are managed in an e-commerce system.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:19px">
        One way to distinguish separate concerns is to follow the Unix philosophy of “do one thing and do it well.”<br>
        When a particular function or class in your code is concerned with a single behavior, you can improve it independent of
        the code that uses it. In contrast, if behaviors are duplicated and mixed together throughout your code, it may be difficult
        to update a particular behavior without thinking about—and in the worst case, breaking—several other behaviors.
        Many functions on a website, for example, might rely on information from the currently authenticated user.
        If they all check authentication and fetch information about that user themselves, they’ll all need to be updated when
        the details about authentication change. That’s a lot of work, and if one function is missed, it may start doing unexpected
        things or stop working altogether.
        <br>

        Separation of Concern at the grass root level is the Single Responsibility principle in SOLID.
        <br>
        <h3>Value of Separation of Concern</h3>

    </p>
    <p style="font-size:19px">
    Applying the principle of separation of concerns to software design can result in a number of residual benefits.
    <b>First</b>, the lack of duplication and singularity of purpose of the individual components render the overall system easier to
    maintain. <b>Second</b>, the system as a whole becomes more stable as a byproduct of the increased maintainability.
    <b>Third</b>, the strategies required to ensure each component only concerns itself with a single set of cohesive responsibilities
    often result in natural extensibility points. <b>Forth</b>, the decoupling which results from requiring components to focus
    on a single purpose leads to components which are more easily reused in other systems, or different contexts within the same system. Fifth, the increase in maintainability and extensibility can have a major impact on the marketability and adoption rate of the system.

    <h3>Separation of Concern in Calculator Program</h3>
</div>
<div class="para1">
    <p style="font-size:19px">
        SOC is used in the Calculator Program such that the program is broken into distinct features that overlap
        in functionality as little as possible. We have broken the original problem of creating a Calculator
        to perform Addition into four independent tasks:<br>
        <br><b>Calculation class with abstract method with encapsulation to define the input values</b>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="al">
    <img class="image" src="https://i.ibb.co/BggLb3F/abs-encap.png" alt="unittest">
</div>

<div class="para1">
    <p style="font-size:19px">
        <br><b>Addition class that adds two or more numbers</b>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="al">
    <img class="image" src="https://i.ibb.co/hHdKmJD/soc-add.png" alt="IOT">
</div>


<div class="para1">
<p style="font-size:19px">
    <br><b>Function to add the Calculation to history</b>
</p>
</div>

<div class="al">
    <img class="image" src="https://i.ibb.co/gr2vd2j/add-cal-soc.png" alt="IOT">
</div>



<div class="para1">
    <p style="font-size:19px">
        <br><b>Calculator class that performs Addition as well as stores the value in the history</b>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="al">
    <img class="image" src="https://i.ibb.co/j68zfv3/calculator-add.png" alt="IOT">
</div>

<div class="para1">
    <p style="font-size:19px">
        In all the above four, all the classes have been
        separated by function, the get_result is first defined in a different class Calculation and then gives us the result of the addition, the add_calculation adds the calculation to history
        and the add_numbers function calls the other two functions together to finally create the proper calculator
        functionality. The four separate classes come together to form the Calculator program, but each action or concern
        is being handled separately and independently
        <br>
        Here it is obvious that the functions have been separated by their concern i.e. their duty, and each of these functions can be reused
        as well as easily modified to accommodate any other new changes or functionality
    </p>
</div>
<div class="para1">
    <p style="font-size:19px">
        The <b>Single Responsibility Principle</b> is also something that on a class/object level is the same as Separation of Concern,
        however the SoC is not limited to Architecture Layers, it’s also applied on many other things, such as:
        an object that could represent a concern from language point view, SOA can separate concerns into services,
        separating behaviour as concern in logical units.
